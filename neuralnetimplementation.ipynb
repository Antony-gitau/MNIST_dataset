The significance is just how important that factor is to determining my going or not. Conventionally, the significance is the weight and the factor is the input. For me to go, I might decide the threshold is a 6. Threshold is conventionally known as bias. This means i will go to the hike if there is a private transport regardless of the other two inputs. Private transport matters to me a big deal. Now, supposing, i changed the threshold to 9 from 6. The decision paradigm changes. I will now go to the hike from atleast a combination of two inputs. We could also change the significance of the inputs and as such, we would have a different decision classifier.\n",
